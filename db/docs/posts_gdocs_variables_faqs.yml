    description: "Many-to-many table linking variables to FAQ content within Google Docs posts. This enables the FAQ system where the data pages for grapher charts can have associated frequently asked questions embedded within special Gdoc posts, providing contextual help and explanations for data indicators. The full chain used to link a chart to an FAQ entry is usually performed in code when rendering data pages, but it roughly goes through these tables: charts -> chart_dimensions -> variables -> posts_gdocs_variables_faqs -> posts_gdocs"
