    description: Database view that aggregates chart reference and usage counts across the platform. This view consolidates complex calculations for narrative charts counts and total references (from published gdocs and explorers) that are used across multiple admin interfaces. The view includes chart slug mappings to handle both direct chart slugs and redirect aliases, ensuring comprehensive reference tracking. This is a computed view, not a physical table.
