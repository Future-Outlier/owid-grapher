metadata:
    description: Data namespaces for organizing datasets by source or organizational structure. Namespaces provide a logical grouping mechanism for datasets, enabling separation between OWID-managed datasets and external data sources (e.g., 'owid', 'worldbank', 'un'). This supports the ETL pipeline's data organization.

    id:
        description: Unique identifier for the namespace
    name:
        description: Namespace name (e.g., 'owid', 'worldbank', 'un')

    isArchived:
        description: Whether the namespace is archived and no longer accepting new datasets
    createdAt:
