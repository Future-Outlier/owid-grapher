        "Pre-aggregated pageview analytics data imported from external analytics system.
        This table stores daily pageview metrics with rolling windows for different time periods.

        Availability:
        - Production and staging databases: populated with live data
        - Local development: empty by default, populated via `make refresh.pageviews`

        Usage for popularity sorting:
        This table is commonly used for joining to sort content by popularity based on the `url` column.
        Since the `url` column stores full URLs, you must prefix slugs appropriately when joining:

        - Charts: prefix with `https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/`
        - Explorers: prefix with `https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/`
        - Other pages (posts_gdocs): prefix with `https://ourworldindata.org/`"
