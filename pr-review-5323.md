PR review for async explorer views refresh (issue #5323) — findings and recommendations

Summary
- Adds jobs-based async processing for explorer view refresh + R2 sync. API enqueues a job on explorer updates; worker processes with retries and explorer status tracking.

What Looks Good
- Jobs schema: Simple, generic queue with useful `(type, state, id)` index.
- API flow: On PUT, `viewsRefreshStatus="queued"` and enqueue `refresh_explorer_views` with `{ slug, explorerUpdatedAt }`.
- Worker flow: DB transaction for explorer_views/chart_configs deltas; R2 deletes/uploads outside transactions; success sets `clean` + `lastViewsRefreshAt`, triggers static build if published; retries with exponential backoff and marks `failed` after max attempts.
- ExplorerViews refresh: Minimal-delta updates, explicit deletion of orphaned chart_configs.

Important Issues To Fix
- Staleness/coalescing bug: `explorerUpdatedAt` from `payload` is a JSON string, compared to a `Date` using `if (current.updatedAt > explorerUpdatedAt)`. That coerces to NaN and always fails, breaking coalescing. Older jobs won’t skip and can publish stale configs.
  - Recommended fix: Normalize types when reading jobs. In `db/model/Jobs.ts` after JSON.parse, cast: `claimedJob.payload.explorerUpdatedAt = new Date(claimedJob.payload.explorerUpdatedAt)`. Do the same in `getJobBySlug`. Alternatively, in `processExplorerViewsJob`, do `const jobUpdatedAt = new Date(explorerUpdatedAt)` and compare against that.
- Coalescing running jobs: Current coalescing only marks older queued jobs as done. If a newer update arrives after a job starts, the running job continues, potentially overwriting with stale results. The later `isJobStillRunning` checks won’t catch supersession because nothing changes the job state.
  - Improvements:
    - Add late-phase staleness checks: before R2 sync and before final mark-as-done, re-fetch `explorers.updatedAt` for `slug` and if `> payload.explorerUpdatedAt`, skip and mark job done as superseded.
    - Optional: On enqueue, also set any running job for the same slug to `done` with `lastError='superseded by newer update'` to enforce single-latest processing (be mindful of race/visibility semantics).
- Unused `lockId`: `claimNextQueuedJob` accepts `lockId` but ignores it. Either remove from signature/logs or store it (e.g., separate audit/logging column) if you plan to leverage it.

Documentation Gaps
- `db/docs/explorers.yml` should document the new columns:
  - `viewsRefreshStatus`: `clean | queued | refreshing | failed` — async refresh status
  - `lastViewsRefreshAt`: last successful refresh timestamp

Minor Notes
- `isPublished` is captured inside a transaction and used later; consider fetching once or marking definite assignment to avoid future TS fragility.
- Comments mention coalescing race conditions; with the fixes above we’ll get much closer to the stated behavior.

Tests and Typecheck
- `yarn typecheck` passes. Tests add async flow coverage but don’t simulate a mid-flight supersession.
- Consider a test: enqueue job A; enqueue job B with newer `updatedAt`; run A and assert it no-ops due to staleness; then run B and assert it processes.

Suggested Next Steps
- Parse `explorerUpdatedAt` to a Date and fix the comparison.
- Add late-phase coalescing checks before R2 and before finalize.
- Update `db/docs/explorers.yml` with the two new fields.
- Optionally supersede running jobs on enqueue or adjust README to reflect actual behavior if we decide not to preempt running jobs.
