These instructions apply to creating new git commits.

Before you make a commit, run `yarn typecheck`, `yarn testLintChanged` and `yarn fixPrettierChanged` and fix any errors that might come up.

For the message, use an emoji from the table below as the start of the commit and add the 🤖 immediately afterwards to indicate this code was written by an AI. Have a look at the last 10 commit messages to get a sense for the style. If the change is simple, try to fit it into one short line, otherwise use a short first line, then an empty line and then create a terse but complete description of the changes.

Show the user the commit message you are about to use and ask if they want to make any change before committing.

emoji - when to use it
🎉 new feature for the user
🐛 bug fix for the user
✨ visible improvement over a current implementation without adding a new feature or fixing a bug
🔨 a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature for the user
📜 changes to the documentation
✅ adding missing tests, refactoring tests, etc. No production code change
🐝 upgrading dependencies, tooling, etc. No production code change
💄 formatting, missing semi colons, etc. No production code change
🚧 Work in progress - intermediate commits that will be explained later on
